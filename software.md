# Software

Please feel free to contact me about the code/data used in our publications.
Some may not be publicly available (sorry!) but we can provide them for the purpose of scientific reproduction.

## Fine-tuned Models

- ü§î [Japanese NLI model](https://huggingface.co/cyberagent/xlm-roberta-large-jnli-jsick)
    - a fine-tuned masked language model using JGLUE-JNLI and JSICK

## Python Scripts

- üßã  [Sonish: Python-ish syntax sugar added to C++](https://github.com/shhshn/sonish)
    - generates readable C++ snippet from restricted Python code
- üêò [Pic2Braille: a picture to text converter written in Python](https://github.com/shhshn/pic2braille)
    - simulates a roughly colored 160x100 dot display using braille characters and ANSI escape code

Old Python 2 scripts are also available for research purpose; no warranty; all rights reserved:
- ‚öñÔ∏è [MW-Classify: a discriminative preordering implementation](https://github.com/shhshn/mw-classify)
    - official implementation of [Hoshino et al. ACL-IJCNLP2015]
- [An implementation of head finalization [Isozaki et al. WMT2010; Isozaki et al. TALLIP2012]](https://gist.github.com/shhshn/5c9d2c110e4dc822af3cf51bd830f9e9)
    - very old script used in our replication studies
- [An implementation of Kendall's tau [Kendall 1938]](https://gist.github.com/shhshn/63471359abd262269cae0b10da769f24)
    - used in the replication study of [Isozaki et al. WMT2010] but modified a bit from their paper
- [An implementation of BLEU [Papineni et al. 2002]](https://gist.github.com/shhshn/344034fee97416788bd6f911add2018d)
    - reproduces the single-reference mode of `multi-bleu.perl`
- [An implementation of IBM model 1 [Brown et al. 1993]](https://gist.github.com/shhshn/696fbf1bc163e923ae4eb6e33a89d2ac)
    - naive (no semi-rings) and unfinished
- [An implementation of IBM model 2 [Brown et al. 1993]](https://gist.github.com/shhshn/cdfe74ba9aee00bbb5ac2fb8abc70f20)
    - somewhat incorrect and unfinished
